Introduction
------------

Simultip simulates tip growth using the viscoplastic model [#Dumais]_,
with the assumptions of thin wall, transverse isotropy and orthogonal
growth. It has been written in order to assess and test hypotheses
developped in the paper "The brown algal mode of tip growth: keeping stress
under control" by Hervé Rabillé *et al*.

.. [#Dumais] Dumais, J., Shaw, S. L., Steele, C. R., Long, S. R. & Ray,
   P. M. (2006) An anisotropic-viscoplastic model of plant cell
   morphogenesis by tip growth. *The International Journal of
   Developmental Biology* **50**, 209-222.

Installing
----------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simultip has been written and tested in a Gnome-Ubuntu environment. Other
unix-like environments should be able to run it.

Simultip requires Python3 installed, by default in ``/usr/bin/python3``.
If your configuration does not match, you can either change the path in
the first line of the script (make sure you leave the ``#!`` characters
at the begining of line), or -- preferably -- create a symbolic link in
``/usr/bin``, pointing to the actual location of your ``python3``
executable.

Some common Python3 libraries have to be installed:

* ``os``, ``argparse``, ``sys``, ``time``, ``datetime``
* ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``

For graphical output, LaTeX is required, with packages:

* ``lang-greek``, ``latex-extra``, ``science``

In addition, output in ``pdf`` requires:

* ``dvipng``

How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no installation procedure, just uncompress the directory and cd
into it::

  tar zxf TipGrowthSoftware.tgz
  cd TipGrowth

The ``simultip.py`` script comes with another file named ``tiputil.py``,
which has to be present:

* in the same directory as ``simultip.py`` (by default);
* or in the appropriate directory of your ``python3`` installation;
* or anywhere in the directory tree provided there is a link named
  ``tiputil.py`` in either of the two places mentioned above

Examples in the section below should run directly.

Parameters and options
----------------------

Command line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage is::

 simultip.py [-h] [-u UNIQUE] [-S SMOOTH] [-T TURGOR] [-w WALL]
 [-m MINWALL] [-z HALFZONE] [-n NUMSTEPS] [-o OVERHANG]
 [-d DELTA] [-s SECONDSBYSTEP] [-g GROWTHBYSUB] [-p PHI]

for *Ectocarpus* tip growth simulation, and are expected to give absolutely
useless results in any other case.

Input file
~~~~~~~~~~

Input file contains in order:

 * 0, 1 or more line(s) of options
 * 1 header line for dat
 * n data lines

An option line is tab-delimited and contains the following fields:

 * 1 parameter name
 * 1 option type which can be ``constant`` or a function name among
   ``sigmoid``, ``gaussian``, ``lockhart``, ``pearson``, ``file``.
 * 1 or more value(s) which is either the constant value, or the
   parameters of the function, or the file name.
 
The options given here override those on the command-line. Note that only
constant values can be set on command line, except for cell wall thickness
(this program **is** *Ectocarpus* oriented).

The header line gives the names of the data, and must contain the
following :
``Set``, ``R``, ``X``, ``s``, ``Phi``, ``Kappa_s``, ``Kappa_t``, ``Nu``
in any order except first column which has to be ``Set``.

Each data line contains values, in the order given by the header.

The friend program ``meancontour.py`` gives suitable header and data lines.

Output
~~~~~~

By default, simultip creates a file named ``simultip_out_XXX.tab`` where
``XXX`` is the Process ID, so successive runs will not overwrite the file.
The output is a tab-delimited file containing the following fields, in
order:

``Dataset``, ``Phi``, ``Sigma_y``, ``Time``, ``G``, ``logRk``, ``logRd``, ``logRe``.

If a "before/after" ``pdf`` is requested (option ``-b``) then the file is
named:

``Simulated_NNN_PPPxSSS_XXX.pdf``

where ``NNN`` is the dataset name, ``PPP`` and ``SSS`` are the number of
different values in Φ and σy ranges, respectively, and ``XXX`` the Process
ID. Note that this option is useless if Φ and/or σy vary with the abscissa
(using a function or file). The ``pdf`` file shows, for each combination of
Φ and σy, the initial and final cell shape and meridional curvature (kappa_s)
plot.

If kinematics are requested, then the program creates directories named
``Global``, ``Vert`` and, in case option ``-Z`` is used, ``Zoom``. Each
directory receives ``png`` files representing the cell state at each time
step.

Examples of use
---------------

Here are some examples which should run out-of-the box:

Launch 9 Ectocarpus simulations with default values:
(Φ,σy) ∈ {2.01E-3, 2.51E-3, 3.01E-3}×{10.18, 11.18, 12.18};
output to a 3×3 heatmap with color scale, data in ``simultip_out_XXXX.tab``
and several indications on terminal::
   
   ./simultip.py -v Ectocarpus_data.tab 

Same simulation array, but force duration to 10h;
output like previous run, along with ``pdf`` charts::
   
   ./simultip.py -n 600 -o 0 -d 60 -b -v Ectocarpus_data.tab

Various heatmaps to locate the best region::
 
   ./simultip.py -p 4.0E-3 -r 2.0E-3 -i 0.5E-3\
   -y 10 -a 2 -j 0.5 -v Ectocarpus_data.tab

   ./simultip.py -p 2.5E-3 -r 0.5E-3 -i 0.1E-3\
   -y 11.0 -a 1.0 -j 0.2 -v Ectocarpus_data.tab

   ./simultip.py -p 2.5E-3 -r 0.05E-3 -i 0.01E-3\
   -y 11.20 -a 0.05 -j 0.01 -v Ectocarpus_data.tab

Launch Ectocarpus simulation with default Φ and σy values,
show results as kinematics, *ie* ``png`` files; output to
``simultip_out_XXXX.tab``::
   
   ./simultip.py -r 0.0 -a 0.0 -k Ectocarpus_data.tab

Troubleshouting
---------------

If you get a warning like this::

  can't invoke "event" command: application has been destroyed
      while executing
  "event generate $w <<ThemeChanged>>"
      (procedure "ttk::ThemeChanged" line 6)
      invoked from within
  "ttk::ThemeChanged"

Then edit (or create) ``~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc`` and add::

  backend : agg
