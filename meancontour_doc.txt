Introduction
------------

Meancontour compute the average symmetric contour of several cells. It has been
written in order to provide initial profile data for Simultip. Both programs are
part of the paper "The brown algal mode of tip growth: keeping stress under
control" by Hervé Rabillé *et al*.

Installing
----------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Meancontour has been written and tested in a Gnome-Ubuntu environment. Other
unix-like environments should be able to run it.

Meancontour requires Python3 installed, by default in ``/usr/bin/python3``. If
your configuration does not match, you can either change the path in the first
line of the script (make sure you leave the ``#!`` characters at the begining
of line), or -- preferably -- create a symbolic link in ``/usr/bin``, pointing
to the actual location of your ``python3`` executable.

In addition, some common libraries have to be installed:

* ``os``, ``arparse``, ``sys``, ``time``, ``datetime``
* ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``

How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no installation procedure, just uncompress the directory and cd into
it::

  tar zxf TipGrowthSoftware.tgz
  cd TipGrowth

The ``meancontour.py`` script comes with another file named ``tiputil.py``,
which has to be present:

* in the same directory as ``simultip.py`` (by default);
* or in the appropriate directory of your ``python3`` installation;
* or anywhere in the directory tree provided there is a link named
  ``tiputil.py`` in either of the two places mentioned above

Parameters and options
----------------------

Command line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage is::

 meancontour.py [-d DENSITY] [-w WINDOW] [-r RANGE]
 [-c CONTOUR] [-t TIP] [-s SMOOTH] [-h] [-v] [-D DEPTH]
 infile

Only ``infile`` is mandatory. Other parameter have default values.

Optional arguments (with default value in parenthesis):

-d DENSITY, --density DENSITY  density of intrapolated points, in points/µm
                               (50).
-w WINDOW, --window WINDOW     window width in nm (100).
-r RANGE, --range RANGE        meridional abscissa range (30)
-c CONTOUR, --contour CONTOUR  contour color (``'#ff00aa'``).
-t TIP, --tip TIP              tip color (``'#55aaaa'``).
-s SMOOTH, --smooth SMOOTH     smoothing of contour spline (1.5).
-h, --help                     show this help message and exit.
-v, --verbose                  write to stdout while working (do not write
                               anything).
-D DEPTH, --depth DEPTH        maximum depth of stack (5000).

Input file
~~~~~~~~~~

The input file is tab-delimited and contains in order:

 * 1 line made of ``*`` followed by the dataset name
 * n lines, one per image to process. Each line contains the path to a file
   image, followed by the width in µm, and if needed, other parameters to apply
   to this image (typically smoothing). The options given here override those
   on the command-line.

Each image is expected to be a black and white photo, on which with the contour
is drawn as a one-pixel wide line, and the tip denoted as a single pixel. Colors
for these elements can be choosen, default are pink and blue, respectively.

Output
~~~~~~

Meancontour creates a file called ``DATASET_dat.tab`` where ``DATASET`` is the
actual dataset name, with the following fields::

  X, Y, s, Phi, Kappa_s, Kappa_t, Nu
  
``X`` and ``Y`` are the coordinates of the point, ``s`` its meridional abscissa,
``Phi`` the angle between the normal and the cell axis, ``Kappa_s`` and
``Kappa_t`` the two main curvatures and ``Nu`` the flow coupling.

In addition, a ``pdf`` file is produced, showing all processing steps.
